abstract: Many conditional cash transfer (CCT) programs have important social components
  and, therefore, can have an effect on social capital. In 2007, we conducted a field
  experiment with 1451 subjects in Cartagena, Colombia. We interpret the behavior
  in the game as a measure of what in the literature has been called social capital.
  We played the game in two similar and adjacent neighborhoods. The ‘treatment’ neighborhood,
  Pozón, had been targeted for over 2 years by a CCT program, Familias en Acción;
  the ‘control’ neighborhood, Ciénaga, had not. In 2008, with the program being implemented
  in both neighborhoods, we played the same public goods game, and were therefore
  able to implement a difference in differences strategy to estimate the impact of
  the CCT on our measure of social capital. In 2007, the level of cooperation we observed
  in the treatment neighborhood was considerably higher than that in the control one.
  Although similar in many dimensions, the two groups turned out to be significantly
  different in some observable variables; the positive result was robust to controls
  for these differences. In 2008, we found that the level of cooperation was statistically
  identical across the two neighborhoods, and similar to the levels observed in 2007
  in the treatment one. We conclude that the CCT program did improve cooperation.
  In analyzing the effect of the CCT on cooperation we also look at other (individual
  and group) determinants of individual behavior in the game, and we compare our measure
  based on behavior in the game to more traditional measures of social capital used
  in the literature that we collected in a context-specific survey.
