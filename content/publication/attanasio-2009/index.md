abstract: Abstract In this paper, we propose a measure of social capital based on
  behaviour in a public goods game. We conducted a public goods game within 28 groups
  in two similar neighbourhoods in Cartagena, Colombia, one of which had been targeted
  for over two years by a conditional cash transfer programme that has an important
  social component. The level of cooperation we observe in the ‘treatment’ community
  is considerably higher than that in the ‘control’ community. The two neighbourhoods,
  however, although similar in many dimensions, turn out to be significantly different
  in other observable variables. The result we obtain in terms of cooperation, however,
  is robust to controls for these observable differences. We also compare our measure
  of social capital with other more traditional measures that have been used in the
  literature.
