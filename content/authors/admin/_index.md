## About Me

I am a development economist working at the intersection of experimental economics and prosocial behavior. My research focuses on the design and evaluation of effective behavioral policy interventions in developing countries. I have conducted large-scale laboratory economic experiments in the field to study the role of prosocial behavior in overcoming collective action problems and promoting the common good.
